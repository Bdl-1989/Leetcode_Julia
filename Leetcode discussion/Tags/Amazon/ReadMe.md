I will add algorithms later here. Stay tuned. <br>

Two node's distance in binary tree<br>

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/07/amazon-phone-screen-find-shortest.html) is my blog about Amazon two node's distance algorithm on Leetcode.com.<br>

**Root to p downward path** <br>

The challenge is to learn how to use backtracking to avoid extra space, and write efficient code. I wrote one in July 4, 2019 based on the version in 2017.

**p to Root upward path**<br>

The challenge is to terminate the traversal once the lowest common ancestor is found. Otherwise the distance variable will be calcuated more than once.
