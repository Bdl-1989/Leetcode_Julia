It takes time for me to learn one algorithm very well. Also I like to fix the weakness on backtracking, and timeout problem solving and recursive function design challenge. <br>

Also I like to be a good interviewer using the algorithm as well. <br>

**Topics** <br>
1. BFS<Br>
2. child-parent map<br>
3. Fix naive solution timeout with complicated function<br>
4. how to build a path from p or q to root<br>
5. how to build a path from root to p<br>
6. Naive solution with Timeout and Complicated function<br>
7. Post order traversal<br>
8. recursive function - Do not understand<br>
9. Recursive solution Easy to understand<br>
10. Recursive solution with backtracking<br>
11. Timeout challenge<br>
